# Major League Baseball Pitching using Python
This project required me to find and design a novel project from data sourcing to presentation. The data used is all pitches hit in play in the 2021 Major Leauge Baseball (MLB) regular season.

### Objectives
Develop an analysis using Python, visualize the results in Tabluea, and present report to an audience.
- Data profiling and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data scaling using scikit-learn library
- Conduct Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm: K-means clustering
- Create visualizations to communicate insights for report
### Programs Used
- Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau
### Repo Organization
1. Project Management (excluded from repo)
2. Data (excluded from repo)
3. Scripts
4. Analysis
### Key Questions
- Can an algorithm identify different baseball pitches?
- How can similar pitches be grouped?
- Which types of pitches are squarely hit more frequently?
- Does high quality contact yield better results for the hitting team?
